        <h2>Our Technology</h2>
        <p>Designed in collaboration with a top pedagogical research lab, I designed an AI agent that synthesizes information from two data sources: lead database, and sales document. These information then gets used to initialize two AI agents: salesperson and the lead. Hundreds of conversations with different parameters (levels of technical understanding, budget constraints, etc.) is simulated, which helps identify different scenarios of synergy and areas of concern, which is used to effectively prepare sales-reps with appropriate information. Additionally, we offer a feedback system that can be used both by AI and human sales mentors, who can review and give feedback on practice sales sessions.</p>
